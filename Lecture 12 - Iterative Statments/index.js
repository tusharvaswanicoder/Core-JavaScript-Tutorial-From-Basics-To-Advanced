/* Iterative statements are used to loop over a block multiple times essentially executing them multiple times.
Three kinds of iterative statements:
1. for loop
2. while loop
3. do while loops
*/

// You can copy paste code multiple times to run it multipal times but thats too complex
{
    console.log("Hello");
}
{
    console.log("Hello");
}
{
    console.log("Hello");
}
{
    console.log("Hello");
}
{
    console.log("Hello");
}
{
    console.log("Hello");
}

// On top of that sometimes you can't predecide on how many times you have to run a block of code. Maybe you want to take number of times to run as a user input like in these cases:

// Print first n numbers

// Calculate sum of first n numbers
